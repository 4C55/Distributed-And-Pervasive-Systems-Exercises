# Prototype

##Task:
Implement the algorithm of Lamport time-stamps in Python (use e.g. the Message Passing Interface) and demonstrate that your implementation can rectify wrong event ordering across at least two nodes in a distributed system

##Solution:
Implementation is available in **main.py**. Results are summarized in **Compare.png**.
